# coding4ch: Coding for Cultural Heritage

This repository serves as the code-base for utilities useful in cultural heritage imaging and mass digitization projects. It is **VERY** much a work in progress . . .

This repository was announced and releassed at the [2020 DT West Coast Round Table](https://dtculturalheritage.com/events/dt-west-coast-round-table-pepperdine/) at Pepperdine University in Malibu, CA on March 12, 2020.

## Getting Started

**Work in progress**

The following steps are necessary to install a development copy of this repository on your computer. This will allow you to assist in the development of this software.

We plan to have instructions for macOS and are considering installation instructions, but these will be tested on a limited number of computers. Please reach out and ask for assistance or help if you're having trouble with any of these steps.

### [Installing on macOS 10.14.6 Mojave](docs/install_macOs-Mojave.md) (untested on macOS Catalalina 10.15)


### [Installing on Windows 10 version 1909](docs/install_win10.md)
