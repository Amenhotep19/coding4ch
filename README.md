# coding4ch: Coding for Cultural Heritage

This repository serves as the code-base for a presentation at the [2020 DT West Coast Round Table](https://dtculturalheritage.com/events/dt-west-coast-round-table-pepperdine/) at Pepperdine University in Malibu, CA on March 12, 2020.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

This code is written for installation on macOS and has been tested on macOS Mojave 10.14.6. The assumption is that you do not have a development environment on your computer before beginning these steps (if you don't know what that means, then you're also good to go!).

Homebrew is used to install Pipenv and Tesseract, which may cause issues if you use MacPorts.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples to install the requisite programs to setup a development environment to run the code in this repository. All of the software to-be-installed below is either:
1. a commercial program included as part of macOS, but not installed by default
1. an open source program

Install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from Apple's App Store
*Required to install to gain access to command-line programs on macOS

```
code example
```

Install [XCode Command-Line Tools](https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&path=%2Fdownload%2Fmore%2F&rv=1) from Apple's Developer site
* May require free Apple developer account
 * Jeremy check if command-line tools can be installed without developer account
* Required to install command-line programs on macOS

```
code example
```

Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
* Code repository management software for version control

```
code example
```

Install [Atom](https://atom.io)
* Text editor

```
code example
```

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* Package manager for macOS
* Turn off analytics if preferred
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Use Homebrew to install Tesseract and Pipenv

```
code example
```

Update Pip and install [Pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/)
* [Real Python article](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/) about Pipenv

```
code example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
